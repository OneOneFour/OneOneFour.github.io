A fun project that originally started out as an experiment on how **SVG's** can be used to create simple games as opposed to the standard bitmap canvas element. I wrote a simple physics simulator from scratch in JavaScript + VueJS to make a simple recreation of classic pub pool. Whilst there is no full scoring mechanism yet, the game does allow for the cue to be freely placed after it has been potted and ends the game when the black is potted.
