A small project I made in the summer of 2016 before starting university. This project uses the **MonoGame** C# framework, which is based on the now legacy Microsoft XNA framework for the graphical backend. A simple version of the *diamond-square* procedural terrain algorithm is used to generate 2D noise which was then coloured accoriding to a manually defined heightmap. After generation I experimented with a variety of smoothness kernels before settling on a form of nearest neighbour averaging.

I also attempted to implement a simple city simulation in this project similar to games like SimCity however in the end time constraints with starting university meant I didn't get very far! I managed to implement a road builder and a simple graphical user interface. The road builder contains various orientation of sprites which are rendered dynamically based on the network map. This project also contains the basis of a pathfinding mechanism for potential agents to navigate around on however again this was left unfinished.
